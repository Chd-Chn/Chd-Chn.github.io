      <h1>Rail and Highway Network Analysis</h1>
    </div>

    <div class="content">
      <div>

        <p>This study provides an assessment of Viet Nam’s rail and highway networks as food transport systems, focusing on three key criteria: <strong>reliability</strong>, <strong>accessibility</strong>, and <strong>reachability</strong>.</p>

        <h3>Rail Network</h3>
        <p>The rail network consists of a single North-South line running from Lào Cai in the north to Ho Chi Minh City in the south. This line primarily hugs the coastline, constrained by high elevation terrain, and doesn’t extend far inland. As a result, the rail network struggles with reliability due to a lack of redundancy and ranks poorly in accessibility and reachability. Given the simplicity of the network, QGIS was sufficient for most of the analysis.</p>

        <h3>Highway Network</h3>
        <p>The national highway network traverses the country from north to south, with secondary highways branching out to provincial capitals and administrative units. This expansive network is more complex and was analyzed using Python and NetworkX. The highway network performs well in all three criteria, particularly in accessibility and reachability, due to its extensive spread of nodes and central hubs.</p>

        <p>When viewed as part of a larger transportation system, which includes the Inland River Waterways (IRW), the rail and highway networks complement each other. The highway network helps alleviate the limitations of the other two networks but is itself over-burdened. This analysis serves as a foundation for future logistical planning and optimization strategies.</p>

        <h2>Context</h2>
      </div>
      <p class="step-description">While the measurement metrics for the rail and highway networks rely less on inference, contextual knowledge remains crucial for interpreting the results. Below are key passenger(mil.person.km) and freight(mil.tons.km) volume data to support accurate interpretations.</p>

        Rail layout: reliability
      </button>
      <div class="accordion-content">
        The reliability of Vietnam's rail network is critically impacted by its layout, with several vulnerabilities posing significant risks to its overall performance. Identifying key problem areas and examining contingency strategies helps to highlight the network's limitations and areas where strategic improvements could enhance resilience and efficiency.
        <br>
        <div class="callout callout-warning">
          <p>1. Vulnerabilities and Contingencies</p>
        </div>
        <p>
          The railway layout shows high vulnerability in central Vietnam. The central rail corridor is a single point of failure—any disruptions here could be catastrophic. Notably, highway networks run parallel to these vulnerable railway segments, suggesting that transportation redundancy is built into the <strong>road network</strong>, rather than the rail infrastructure.
        </p>
        <p>
          Similarly, northern rail lines parallel rivers and extend toward the eastern coast. These too rely on highway networks for contingency. In contrast, the railway terminates at <strong>Ho Chi Minh City</strong>, leaving the southern region disconnected from rail service entirely.
        </p>
        <p>
          The rail system lacks <strong>built-in redundancy</strong>, relying instead on the road network for fallback during service disruptions.
        </p>
        <div class="callout callout-warning">
          <p>2. Regional Accessibility and Infrastructure Gaps</p>
        </div>
        <p>
          Geographic constraints and network layout contribute to <strong>uneven regional accessibility</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Rising freight traffic distances, despite reduced tonnage, suggest a <strong>misalignment between demand and infrastructure capability</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
          There is a clear <strong>opportunity for investment</strong> in southern Vietnam, where rail service is absent.

    <h3>General view of the highway network</h3>
    <p>A comprehensive visual analysis of the highway network is conducted using networkX, shedding light on its structure and connectivity. Key segments of the highway network are plotted to reveal both the strengths and potential vulnerabilities of the system. Centrality measures, including betweenness, closeness, and eigenvector centrality, are employed to assess the overall performance and efficiency of the network. To streamline the analysis, a simplified regional classification—Northern, Central, and Southern—reduces complexity while preserving the core insights. This method supports both global and local analyses, pinpointing critical nodes and connections, and identifying areas that may benefit from further optimization.</p>

          <p><strong>In transportation and infrastructure analysis, diameter</strong> is a key metric that reveals the longest shortest path between any two nodes in a network, highlighting the network's reach and potential vulnerabilities.</p>

          <p>For instance, the largest component has a diameter of <strong>85</strong>, indicating significant travel distances. However, this wide reach also exposes the network to risks. Critical nodes and <strong>cut edges</strong>—connections whose removal would fragment the network—are essential in identifying weak points.</p>

          <p>These vulnerable areas, particularly near the <strong>eastern, western, and central regions</strong>, underscore the potential for major disruptions if key components fail. This static graph analysis identifies structural vulnerabilities and potential bottlenecks under normal conditions. While useful for resilience planning, dynamic disruptions (e.g., floods or demand surges) would require temporal simulations.</p>

          <p>Understanding <strong>diameter</strong> and <strong>cut edges</strong> enables smart, cost-effective infrastructure planning, reducing risks and optimizing the flow of traffic across large systems.</p>

      <h4>Global vs. Local Centrality: A Dual Perspective</h4>
      <p>Understanding both <strong>global</strong> and <strong>local centrality</strong> in a network is crucial for identifying key nodes that drive overall system performance.</p>

      <p><strong>Global centrality</strong> reveals nodes with the greatest influence across the entire network, essential for strategic decision-making and optimizing large-scale interactions.</p>

      <p>On the other hand, <strong>local centrality</strong> focuses on the role of nodes within their immediate neighborhoods, offering insights into localized efficiencies and vulnerabilities.</p>

      <p>The network is evaluated using three centrality metrics: betweenness, closeness, and degree. Each is computed at both global and regional (local) levels, revealing how centrality shifts when the network is partitioned into northern, central, and southern zones.</p>


      <div class="accordion-item">
        <button class="accordion-button" aria-expanded="false">
          Global Betweeness Centrality
        </button>
        <div class="accordion-content">

          <p><strong>Betweenness Centrality</strong> measures how often a node lies on the shortest paths between different pairs of nodes. Nodes with high betweenness centrality can act as bridges between two groups, facilitating communication and traffic flow.However, when these nodes are overloaded, they can become bottlenecks. Unlike cut vertices, which can fragment a network upon failure, nodes with high betweenness centrality do not necessarily break apart components due to the presence of redundant paths</p>

          <p>This concept is reinforced when combined with clustering coefficients, as both metrics highlight the strengths and weaknesses of network nodes. For instance, global betweenness centrality identifies nodes with significant bridging roles, capable of connecting large portions of the network. These nodes may play a critical role in maintaining network efficiency but could also become chokepoints if not managed carefully.</p>

        <div class="accordion-content">

          <p>When comparing global to local betweenness, it becomes clear that nodes that are less significant on a global scale gain importance when the analysis is confined to a smaller, local area. Nodes that may not show up as major global hubs can become crucial bridges or bottlenecks in their specific region.</p>

          <p>This local view highlights the nodes that are critical to regional performance, where bridge nodes with lesser global significance become prominent in the local context. It is also evident that these bridge nodes, especially in the northern and central regions, form tight-knit clusters, indicating strong local connections. The ability to recognize these nodes allows for a more targeted and effective approach to planning and optimizing regional logistics and distribution networks, particularly for scenarios like food distribution across different regions.</p>

          <p><strong>Closeness centrality</strong> measures how efficiently a node can reach all other nodes in a network. It differs from betweenness centrality by ignoring the node’s bridging role and instead focusing solely on reachability.</p>

          <p>Nodes with high global closeness centrality are concentrated along the eastern coast, aligning with known seaport locations. These nodes can efficiently reach all other nodes—based on shortest weighted paths—not necessarily geographic proximity.</p>

          <p>This global perspective provides a network-wide view of potential key entry points for logistics, including food or aid distribution, where speed and reach are critical.</p>

          <p>In contrast to the global view, <strong>local closeness centrality</strong> highlights efficient nodes within regional contexts. Breaking the network into northern, central, and southern zones, reveals a broader spread of high-closeness nodes across each region.</p>

          <p>Although the results resemble the global distribution, more nodes emerge with varied closeness levels, reflecting localized efficiencies. This view is particularly useful when designing region-specific strategies, such as identifying the best-positioned nodes for receiving incoming food transfers within each region.</p>

          <p>Evaluating closeness at a local level supports more granular logistics planning and ensures responsiveness across multiple decentralized regions.</p>

        <div class="accordion-content">

          <p><strong>Degree centrality</strong> quantifies how many direct connections a node has. In a global view, pairing this metric with closeness centrality reveals different node roles, such as hubs, shortcuts, distributed hubs, or peripheral nodes.</p>

          <p>The plot visualizes this pairing across the entire network. Few nodes qualify as full hubs (high-degree, high-closeness); instead, many distributed hubs appear along the eastern coast. This pattern reinforces findings from closeness centrality alone, showing that coverage is prioritized over redundancy.</p>

          <p>The global degree view is critical for identifying structural strengths and weaknesses that affect the network’s ability to scale or absorb disruptions.</p>

        <div class="accordion-content">

          <p>Local degree centrality is visualized across the north, central, and south regions, with high-degree nodes marked in red, yellow, and cyan, respectively. The analysis shows that the south contains more highly connected nodes compared to the other regions.</p>

          <p>This pattern aligns with similar findings in local betweenness, as both centrality types favor nodes with many connections. It indicates stronger intra-regional connectivity in the south, while the north and central regions remain more sparse.</p>

          <p>While degree centrality identifies well-connected nodes, it is used here as a proxy for potential throughput. Actual capacity-based throughput would require volume or flow data, which are not incorporated in this analysis.</p>
