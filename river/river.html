      <h1>Inland River Network(IRW) Analysis</h1>
    </div>

    <div class="content">
      <p class="step-description">
        Inland rivers form a vital transport backbone in Viet Nam, particularly in keeping costs down for rice farmers. Yet they’re highly vulnerable to dissication during the dry season—typically peaking in March, while the wettest months are around August.
      </p>
      <p class="step-description">
        Many river ports, especially those farther inland, are little more than open clearings. They often shift or disappear entirely from satellite maps depending on the season.
      </p>
      <p class="step-description">
        Unsurprisingly, as of 2021, the Inland River Waterway (IRW) network is not ranked highly in its contribution to food security.

            <p class="step-description">IRW assessment depends heavily on inference. Contextual knowledge holds equal, if not greater, importance than the supporting statistics involved. Here are two key requisite areas of knowledge for making high-quality inferences.</p>

                    These freight volume charts provide the baseline understanding of inland river waterways (IRWs) throughput by province. When combined with river flow rates and river port centrality measures, they offer a more complete inference about the overall quality and effectiveness of the IRW system. River flow rates reflect the river's capacity as a viable transport channel, while centrality measures indicate how strategically a river port is positioned within the network.

              <li>Betweenness Centrality – Flow control: how often a node lies on the shortest paths between others.</li>
              <li>Closeness Centrality – Access efficiency: how quickly a node can reach all others in the network.</li>

              <p>Transport Demand Drives Clustering</p>
            </div>
            <p>In the Mekong Delta, 93% of paddy is transported via inland rivers. In the north, farmers depend on seasonal transport to support rotating rice and vegetable production cycles.</p>
            
            <div class="callout callout-warning">
              <p>Degree Centrality Reflects Economic Hubs</p>
            </div>
            <p>High-degree nodes gather around Ho Chi Minh City and Ha Noi, highlighting dense connectivity needs. Central highland regions, with low population and elevation challenges, exhibit fewer connections.</p>

              <p>Betweenness Reveals Strategic Bottlenecks</p>
            </div>
            <p>Southern clusters are dense but may mask true chokepoints. Northern ports on major river axes show high betweenness—failures here could fragment national transport.</p>

          QGIS: River flow direction analysis

        <div class="accordion-content">

          <p>
            The <strong>River Flow Direction</strong> tool in QGIS uses elevation data from a Digital Elevation Model to map how water flows across terrain. It shows the downhill direction of flow from each point, helping identify natural drainage paths and potential river channels.
          </p>

          <p>
            The results corroborate the findings of other inland river network metrics by grounding them in physical geography. It validates where reliable flow supports transport, and, when considered alongside centrality and throughput data, helps explain which ports are viable year-round and which are limited by seasonal desiccation.
