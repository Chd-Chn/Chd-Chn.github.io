  <p>Why Vietnam welcomes Foreign Direct Investment (FDI)</p>

  <details>
    <summary><strong>FDI fuels economic development (1991–2022)</strong></summary>
    Attracting FDI helped Vietnam develop its post-war economy, laying the foundation for improving food access and national well-being.
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary><strong>Shifting labor from farms to factories</strong></summary>
    As FDI drove industrial growth, labor reallocated from agriculture to manufacturing — changing income patterns and triggering migration.
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary><strong>Encouraging rural modernization</strong></summary>
    With labor moving out of farming, Vietnam is motivated to adopt agricultural technologies to maintain productivity and food output.
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary><strong>Targeted regional development (2008)</strong></summary>
    Major FDI pledges focused on the North Central and Central Coast regions, aiming to improve infrastructure and economic access there.
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary><strong>Managing external shocks (e.g. 2008 crisis)</strong></summary>
    Vietnam’s experience with delayed implementation during the Global Financial Crisis highlighted the need for resilient investment strategies.
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary><strong>Focus on manufacturing sector (2010–2022)</strong></summary>
    Most FDI went into manufacturing, creating jobs and raising income levels — key pillars that support long-term food affordability and security.
